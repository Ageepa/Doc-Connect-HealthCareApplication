**Doc-Connect Healthcare Application**

**Overview**

Doc-Connect Healthcare Application is a comprehensive medical management system designed to streamline the interaction between patients and healthcare providers. This project exemplifies the use of objectoriented programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation, to create a robust and flexible application that meets the needs of both administrators and patients.

**Key Features**

**Administrator Interface**

-Doctor Management: Administrators can add new doctors to the system, specifying their name, birthday, specialization, and contact information. Each doctor is assigned a unique ID, ensuring easy identification and management.

-Availability Management: Administrators can add availability slots for doctors, specifying the exact dates they are available. This feature ensures that doctors' schedules are accurately maintained and can be accessed by patients when booking appointments.

**Patient Interface**

-Doctor Directory: Patients can view a comprehensive list of all available doctors, including their specializations and availability. This feature allows patients to choose the best-suited doctor for their needs.

-Appointment Booking: Patients can book appointments with their chosen doctors by selecting an available date. The system supports both general and referral appointments, providing flexibility in the type of care patients can receive.

-Booking Details: Patients can view the details of their booked appointments, including the date, time, and any additional notes or instructions from the doctor.

**Appointment Management**

-General Appointments: Patients can book general appointments, specifying patient notes that may be relevant to the consultation. The system ensures that appointment slots are managed efficiently, preventing overbooking.

-Referral Appointments: For cases requiring specialized care, patients can book referral appointments with a referral doctor. This feature supports entering referral notes, ensuring comprehensive communication between the primary and referral doctors.

**Data Persistence**

-Doctor and Patient Records: The application maintains detailed records of all doctors and patients, ensuring consistent data access and manipulation. These records are essential for tracking appointments and managing schedules.

-Appointment History: Both doctors and patients can access a history of all past appointments, providing a detailed overview of interactions and medical history.
